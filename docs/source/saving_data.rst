Saving data
===========

The module that reads data streams and saves them to disk is ``dasa`` and in the web-interface it is identified as ``data_saver`` (see :numref:`fig-ABCD-data-saver-empty`).
Files can be saved with the ABCD data formats (see :numref:`ch-data-files`).
See :numref:`sec-tutorial-saving-data` for an extensive description on how to use the data saving interface.
